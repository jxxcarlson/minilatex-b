 We are about to embark on an ambitious project, namely, to implement the function "fromAST" in module Scripta.ToString. 
  I have written some failing tests in tests/ConversionTest.elm .  Our first task is to make these succeed. After we                     
  reach that milestone, I will add further tests.  We will then make them succeed.  It will take several rounds                          
  of this process before we have an adequate means of converting MiniLaTeX files to Scripta files.
